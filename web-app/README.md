# Claexa AI Web Application

Claexa AI is a platform of AI tools designed for students and educators, offering question paper generation, AI-powered problem solving, and educational content creation.

## Features

- AI-powered question paper generation
- Question solving assistance
- Educational content creation
- Cross-platform accessibility

## Progressive Web App (PWA) Support

This application includes Progressive Web App functionality for improved performance, offline support, and a better mobile experience. The PWA features are implemented in a non-intrusive way:

- **Offline Support**: Core functions work even without an internet connection
- **Performance**: Assets are cached for faster loading times
- **No Intrusive Prompts**: No automatic install prompts or update notifications
- **Silent Updates**: Updates are applied silently in the background
